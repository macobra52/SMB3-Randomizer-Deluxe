#  SMB3-Randomizer-Deluxe

SMB3 Randomizer Deluxe is an expansion of fcoughlin’s SMB3 Randomizer that combines the two programs to deliver even more features to the classic randomizer you know and love. With his permission and blessing, both programs have been packaged together into one distribution, allowing Deluxe to automate generation of the ‘base’ randomized game and enhance it further with additional patches and randomization! Deluxe exclusive features include:

- More options for Starting Lives
- The ability to select the game length in terms of Number of Worlds
- Randomize level paths, including where doors and pipes take you, and which direction you go
- Randomize autoscrolling of autoscroller levels (whether they do and how fast)
- Randomize additional obstacles, such as conveyer belts and spinners
- Insert every level into the game, beta stages included
- Deja vu mode with the above option, where duplicate levels can appear
- Add random power-ups to beta stages that normally don’t have one
- Randomize whether locks and/or bridges appear on the final World 8 screen
- Remove full screen flashing effects from the game
- Play as Peach or Toad (to keep things fair, Peach cannot float here)
- Gameplay changes, such as the ability to enter an occupied Kuribo shoe from above and tail attacking while swimming
- Optional buffs to the frog suit, tanooki suit, and music box
- Bring back the castle airship flying away on death
- Make all of World 8 dark (instead of just the third screen)
- Options to drastically increase difficulty, such as reduced time, ice physics everywhere, and ‘kaizo’ enemies
- A whole new game mode called Open World
- and much, much more!

# Getting Started

Once you have SMB3 Randomizer Deluxe downloaded, simply extract the folder to your preferred location and open **Mario3RandomizerDeluxe.exe**

1. Click **Select ROM File** and select the location of your original unmodified SMB3 game (PRG0 or PRG1 preferred).

2. Click **Select Output Folder** and select the preferred location where you want randomized games to be saved.

3. Enter a **Seed**, or simply use the one provided.

4. Enter the **Base Flags**, or select a preset from the drop-down. These will be automatically inserted into fcoughlin’s SMB3 randomizer.
- To assist with creating a custom flagset, you can click **Open Base Randomizer** (lower left) to easily open it from within Deluxe and customize the options to your liking. When done, simply copy and paste the flags over into Deluxe.

5. Select your desired options, or enter the **Mac Flags** as needed
- Every option has a relevant toolip when hovered over containing more info on what the option does
- To reset all options to default (aside from any aesthetic tweaks), simply enter ‘0’.
- **Presets** allow you to save up to eight Mac Flags for later reference. Clicking a Preset in the dropdown will automatically apply the selected flags. Click **Save** to save the current Mac Flags into the selected Preset slot (to select a different slot, you will need to copy the flags, select the desired slot, then paste your flags back in so they are not lost)

6. Click **Generate!**

Once you click Generate, an automated process will occur that will open the base randomizer to create the initial randomized game before applying the selected Deluxe options. To ensure everything works correctly, do **NOT** interrupt this process until it is complete and you see the ‘Patches applied successfully’ message.

Enjoy!
